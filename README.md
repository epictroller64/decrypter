# decrypter

Node.js program to capture and decrypt stream links from providers such as UpCloud and VidCloud.
Works by first downloading player script, then removing unecessary functions using Javascript AST parser and finally extracting the found encryption key.

Currently outdated and have no plans to fix it at the moment.
